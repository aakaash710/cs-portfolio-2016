<p id=howto>
    Step 1: Do research on the history of a motherboard
    <br>
    History of a Motherboard: The Motherboard is the main Circuit Board found in microcomputers and other systems. 
    It allows communication between many of the electronic components of a system.
    A motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems such as the central processor, input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors and other components integrated for general use. 
    The motherboard is often referred to as the mother of all components as the name suggests. 
    The CPU, memory and peripherals were housed on individual circuit boards which were plugged into the backplate.
    Laptop and notebook computers that were developed in the 1990s integrated the most common peripherals.
    This included motherboards with no upgradeable components, a trend that would continue as smaller systems that were introduced after the turn of the century.

    Step 3: Do research on Types of RAM
    <br>
    Two Widely used forms of modern RAMS are Static RAM(SRAM) and Dynamic RAM(DRAM). 
    In SRAM, a bit of data is stored using the state of a six transistor memory cell.
    This form is more expensive, but is faster and requires less dynamic power than DRAM.
    DRAM stores a bit of data using a transistor and capacitor pair, which together comprise a DRAM memory cell.

    Step 5: Research specifics of how the Hard Drive works
    <br>
    The hard drive is an incredibly efficient computer memory device that uses simple magnetism to store vast amounts of informations.
    In your laptop there's just a large shiny circular plate of magnetic material called a platter. 
    In a hard drive you can find a read-write arm, an Actuator that moves the read-write arm, a Central Spindle, a Magnetic Platter, Plug connections that link the hard drive to circuit board in personal computer, A small spindle that allow read-write arm to swing across platter.
