        <p id="AboutPage" style="width: 625px" ;> I have been to about 6 countries outside the US. I've been to Canada, Mexico, India, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Kenya. I love to play video games, but mostly sports video games. My 2 favorite video games are NBA 2k and Madden. NBA 2k17 came out
            on Fri, September 16. I used to be in Boy Scouts. I was in Troop 153. But I quit after a year and a half. I quit because like I said before, in 6th grade I went to study in India for a year. After I came back from India I lost my interest in Boy Scouts.
            One TV Show I watch is called the Amazing Race. There has been 28 seasons of the Amazing Race. In the Amazing race there are either 10,11 or 12 teams of 2 that race around the world for a million dollars. There have been internaional versions
            of the Amazing Race. There has been a exception of the 2 people per team rule. In season 8 of the US version, there were families of 4 racing for the million dollars. I started watching the Amazing Race when I was 8 years old. It is one of
            my favorite TV Shows.</p>
