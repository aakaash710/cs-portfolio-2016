    </div>
    <p id="HardwarePage">
        The Motherboard is the main Circuit Board found in microcomputers and other systems. It allows communication between many of the electronic components of a system. A motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems such as the central processor, input/output
        and memory controllers, interface connectors and other components integrated for general use. The motherboard is often referred to as the mother of all components as the name suggests. The CPU, memory and peripherals were housed on individual
        circuit boards which were plugged into the backplate.Laptop and notebook computers that were developed in the 1990s integrated the most common peripherals. This included motherboards with no upgradeable components, a trend that would continue
        as smaller systems that were introduced after the turn of the century. Modern motherboards include Sockets, a chipset, Non voltaile memory chips, A clock generator, Slots for expansion cards and Power Connectors. The sockets are where mictoprocessors
        are installed. The CPU is directly soldered to the motherboard. A chipset forms an interface between the CPU's front side bus, main memory and peripheral base. The Non Voltaire Memory Chips contain the systems firmware or BIOS. A clock generator
        produces the system clock signal to synchronize the various components. The Slots for expansion cards are the interface to the system via the buses supported by the chipset.

    <h2 id=heading>Types of RAM</h2>
    <p id=HardwarePage>
        Two Widely used forms of modern RAMS are Static RAM(SRAM) and Dynamic RAM(DRAM). In SRAM, a bit of data is stored using the state of a six transistor memory cell. 
        A bit is the smallest unit of data in a computer. A bit has a single binary value, either 0 or 1. A six transistor memory cell is a type of semiconductor memory that use bistable latching circuitry to store each bit.
        This form is more expensive, but is faster and requires less dynamic power than DRAM. DRAM
        stores a bit of data using a transistor and capacitor pair, which together comprise a DRAM memory cell.
        A capacitor is an electronic component used for storing charge and energy. The usual capacitor is a pair of parallel plates seperted by a small distance.

    <h2 id=heading>Parts of a Hard Drive</h2>
    <p id=HardwarePage>
        The hard drive is an incredibly efficient computer memory device that uses simple magnetism to store vast amounts of informations. In your laptop there's just a large shiny circular plate of magnetic material called a platter. In a hard drive you can
        find a read-write head, an Actuator that moves the read-write arm, a Central Spindle, a Magnetic Platter, Plug connections that link the hard drive to circuit board in personal computer, and a small spindle that allow read-write arm to swing across
        platter. A read-write head is a specific physical part of a hard disk that is responsible for reading data from, and writing dato to, the disk. They are usually made up of a thin horizontal magnetic blade attached to an actuator arm.
        A spindle is a shaft that holds a rotating hard disk drive platters in place. A platter is the circular disk on which magnetic data is stored in a hard disk drive.
